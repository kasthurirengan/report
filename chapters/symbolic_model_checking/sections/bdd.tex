Boolean expressions can be represented using a rooted, direct, acyclic graph called the BDD. BDD was first introduced by Lee\cite{Lee,1959}. An efficient data structure for representing the BDD and efficient algorithms for manipulating BDD's were later developed by \cite{Bryant 1986}. He also introduced the concept of ordering of variables in a BDD, which would affect the size significantly.
